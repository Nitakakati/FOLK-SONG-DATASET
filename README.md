	Bihu Geet:

Assam's national event is called the Bihu festival. The most valuable Bohag bihu is revered as the Assamese culture's essence. As spring begins to blossom everywhere, the Assamese people begin to sing and dance the bihu nam, or "Bihu Song," as a way of expressing their delight and happiness. These songs have their roots in nature. Bihu songs are an essential component of Hunsori, where participants sing and dance in the homes' courtyards to bless the homeowner and his family. The bihu nam's subject expresses people's love, hope, and enthusiasm for bihu.
 The melodic framework of bihu songs differs from that of classical or other contemporary music.
	
    Kamrupia Geet:

The Kamrup region of Assam has long been a place where people have expressed their sentiments and emotions via songs known as Kamrupia Lokogeet. The daily lives of the Kamprupi people, the relationship between a married woman and her family, and certain religious themes like the legends of the Ramayana and Mahabharata are the major subjects of the work.
	
    Goalparia Lok Geet:
    
The people of Assam who speak the Goalporiya language sing this kind of folk music. These songs' main topic is melancholy in love (Biroh), albeit not all of them are centered on it. Some are grounded on philosophy, agriculture, God-worship, the Goalporiya people's way of life, etc. The Koch Rajbonshi people have preserved this kind of music via their festivals. Protima Pandey Boruah is a well-known Assamese figure who popularized this musical form throughout the country.
